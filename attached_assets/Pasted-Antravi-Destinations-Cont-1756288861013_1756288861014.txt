FAQ;S 

1. Which is the best time to visit the Maldives?
The Maldives is beautiful year-round, but the best time to visit is between November and April, when the skies are clear and the seas are calm — perfect for honeymoons and beachside moments. That said, we also help travelers plan magical escapes in the off-season, where you can enjoy fewer crowds and better resort value.

🛬 2. Do Indians need a visa for the Maldives?
No visa hassles here! Indian passport holders receive a free Visa on Arrival for up to 30 days. All you need is a passport valid for at least 6 months, a confirmed return flight, and your hotel booking — which we’ll provide you after confirmation. We’ll guide you through everything.
